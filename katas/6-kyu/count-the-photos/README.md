In a string we describe a road. There are cars that move to the right and we denote them with ">" and cars that move to the left and we denote them with "<". There are also cameras that are indicated by: " . ". 
<br>
A camera takes a photo of a car if it moves to the direction of the camera.

<b style="font-size: 20px;">Task</b> <br>
Your task is to write a function such that, for the input string that represents a road as described, returns the total number of photos that were taken by the cameras. The complexity should be strictly O(N) in order to pass all the tests. 

<br>
<b>Examples</b>

```javascript
For ">>." -> 2 photos were taken
For ".>>" -> 0 photos were taken
For ">.<." -> 3 photos were taken
For ".><.>>.<<" -> 11 photos were taken
```
