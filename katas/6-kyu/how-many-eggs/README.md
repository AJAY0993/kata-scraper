Ronald's uncle left him 3 fertile chickens in his will. When life gives you chickens, you start a business selling chicken eggs which is exactly what Ronald decided to do. 

A chicken lays 300 eggs in its first year. However, each chicken's egg production decreases by 20% every following year (rounded down) until when it dies (after laying its quota of eggs). 

After his first successful year of business, Ronald decides to buy 3 more chickens at the start of each year.  

<br>

<p><b>Your Task: </b></p>

For a given <u><i>year</i></u>, and life span of chicken <u><i>span</i></u>,  calculate how many eggs Ronald's chickens will lay him that year, whereby <i>year=1</i> is when Ronald first got his inheritance and <i>span>0</i>.

If <i>year=0</i>, make sure to return "No chickens yet!".

<br>
<p><b>Note: </b></p>
1. All chickens have the same life span regardless of when they are bought. 
<p>2. Let's assume all calculations are made at the end of the year so don't bother taking eggs laid per month into consideration. 
<p>3. <b><u>Each</u></b> chicken's egg production goes down by 20% each year, NOT the total number of eggs produced by each 'batch' of chickens. While this might appear to be the same thing, it doesn't once non-integers come into play so take care that this is reflected in your kata!
